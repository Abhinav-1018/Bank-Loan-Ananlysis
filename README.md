# Bank Loan Analysis Project
## Project Overview
The Bank Loan Analysis Project is a comprehensive analytics initiative focused on improving loan performance and optimizing lending strategies. By analyzing key metrics such as loan status, funded amounts, interest rates, and borrower risk profiles, this project provides data-driven insights to enhance decision-making in lending operations.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 38,500 fields covering various loan-related attributes:
Loan Details: Loan amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and terms.
Borrower Information: Employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership.
Geographic Data: Loan location and regional trends.
Loan Status: Distinction between "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans" based on repayment status.

## Project Objectives
Develop dynamic dashboards to monitor loan performance and lending activities.
Track critical KPIs to assess the health and risk of the loan portfolio.
Identify high-performing loans and regions with potential growth or risk.
Empower stakeholders with interactive, real-time loan insights.

## Tools & Technologies
MS SQL Server: Data storage, querying, and preparation.
Power BI: Visualizations and interactive dashboards for actionable insights.

## Project Highlights
