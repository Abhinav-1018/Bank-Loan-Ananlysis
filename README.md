Project Overview: The goal was to create a series of dashboards that offer a 360-degree view of our bank’s loan portfolio. By leveraging the capabilities of MS SQL Server for data management and Power BI for dynamic visualization, we’ve developed an end-to-end solution that tracks and analyzes critical loan metrics, helping our team make informed, data-driven decisions.

Key Features and Insights:

Summary Dashboard:

Total Loan Applications: Monitors the total number of loan applications, with breakdowns for Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.
Total Funded Amount & Amount Received: Provides a clear view of the funds disbursed and received, enabling us to assess cash flow and lending performance.
Average Interest Rate & Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Tracks these crucial indicators to evaluate loan profitability and borrower risk profiles.
Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:

Differentiates between ‘Good Loans’ and ‘Bad Loans,’ offering insights into application success rates, funded amounts, and received payments. This analysis is vital for understanding the quality of our loan portfolio and mitigating risks.
Loan Status Grid View:

Provides a detailed, categorized overview of loan statuses, helping us quickly identify patterns and make data-driven adjustments to our lending practices.
Overview Dashboard:

Monthly Trends: Analyzes trends in loan applications, funded amounts, and amounts received over time, revealing seasonal patterns and long-term trajectories.
Regional Analysis: Breaks down lending metrics by state, helping us identify regional disparities and tailor our strategies accordingly.
Loan Term, Employee Length, Loan Purpose, and Home Ownership Analysis: These insights enable us to better understand our borrowers’ profiles and how various factors influence lending outcomes.
Details Dashboard:

Consolidates all essential loan data into an intuitive, user-friendly interface, making it easier for stakeholders to access critical information and gain a comprehensive view of the bank’s loan portfolio.
Technology Stack: To bring this project to life, I utilized MS SQL Server for creating the necessary data structures, followed by Power BI to design and implement the dashboards. These tools allowed us to seamlessly integrate data, visualize trends, and create an impactful narrative around our bank’s lending activities.

Impact and Benefits: This project has empowered our team with the ability to:

Identify and address trends early, ensuring proactive management of our loan portfolio.
Distinguish between high and low-performing loans, allowing for more targeted lending strategies.
Enhance decision-making with a clear view of critical metrics, from borrower profiles to regional lending trends.
